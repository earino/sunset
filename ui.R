HTML('<h1>About</h1><p>This is a simple shiny app written by <a href="http://DataScience.LA/team/#earino">Eduardo Ari√±o de la Rubia</a>.
There is almost no real work in this app, and all the real work was done by 
     <a href="http://hilaryparker.com/">Hilary Parker</a> in her blog post
     <a href="http://hilaryparker.com/2014/05/27/sunsets-in-google-calendar-using-r/">Sunsets in Google Calendar using R</a>.
     </p>
     <p>I wanted to share this with some non-technical friends, and unfortunately
     simply installing and using R was a bridge too far. So, thanks to the fine
     folks at <a href="http://rstudio.org">RStudio</a> and their awesome <a href="https://www.shinyapps.io/">ShinyApps.io</a>
     shiny hosting service. I was able to throw a Shiny app for anyone to use
     in about 15 minutes during lunch.<p>
     <h1>How to use?</h1>
     <p>I will again direct you to <a href="http://hilaryparker.com/2014/05/27/sunsets-in-google-calendar-using-r/">Hilary\'s post</a> regarding how you actually get
      this file ingested by Google Calendar. However, to actually generate the
      CSV simply select the Timezone you will be in, the City you will see the
     sunset from, when you want the calendar to start, and how many days you 
     want a file generated for.</p>
     <p>Enjoy!</p>
     <h1>Inspiration</h1>
     <p>I captured this sunset with my beautiful wife <a href="http://DataScience.LA/team/#leigh">Leigh</a> 
     in Santa Monica on the Winter Solstice in 2014. After seeing such a beautiful
     sunset, we decided that we should see more of them in the coming year, so I
     did what any Data Scientist would do... I stole some code from someone way
     smarter than me and built a this little tool :-)</p>
